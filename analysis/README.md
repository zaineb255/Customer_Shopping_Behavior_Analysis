   # Customer_Shopping_Behavior_Analysis
An end-to-end analysis of retail customer behavior to uncover insights and spending patterns

## Overview
This project explores and analyzes a retail customer shopping behavior dataset to help a company better understand how customers interact with its products, discounts, and subscription programs.

The analysis was conducted as a complete data analytics workflow  from cleaning and modeling data in Python, to performing SQL-based business queries, and finally visualizing insights in Power BI.

By combining these tools, the project answers key business questions such as:

•	Which product categories drive the most purchases?

•	How do discounts and reviews influence buying behavior?

•	Which customer segments are the most loyal or profitable?

•	Are repeat buyers more likely to subscribe to the company’s programs?

The final outcome is a set of data-driven insights and recommendations that can help the company improve marketing strategies, customer retention, and sales performance

## Deliverables
#### Data Preparation & Modeling (Python)

•	Cleaned and transformed the raw dataset (customer_shopping_behavior.csv).

•	Removed nulls, standardized column names, and ensured consistent data types.

•	Connected Python to SQL Server via SQLAlchemy using local instance

•	Uploaded the cleaned data to SQL Server for advanced analysis.

#### Data Analysis (SQL Server)

•	Wrote and executed multiple analytical queries to uncover key insights such as:

o	Top products and categories by purchases and revenue

o	Discount effectiveness and review impact

o	Customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal)

o	Relationship between repeat buyers and subscription likelihood

#### Visualization & Insights (Power BI)
•	Built an interactive Power BI dashboard (customers.pbix) highlighting:

o	Total revenue and average spend per segment

o	Product performance by category

o	Discount vs. non-discount behavior

o	Customer loyalty metric

 ######          Key Insights
